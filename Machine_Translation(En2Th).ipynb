But because the \\ndamage from such an event could be great, NASA leads hypothetical asteroid impact \\n“tabletop” exercises every two years with experts and decision -makers from fed eral and \\ninternational agencies to address the many uncertainties of an impact scenario. The  most \\nrecent exercise  took place this past April, with a preliminary report being issued on June 20.  \\nMaking such a scenario realistic and useful for all involved is no small task. Scientists from the \\nCenter for Near Earth Object Studies ( CNEOS) at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern \\nCalifornia, which specializes in the tracking and orbital determination of asteroids and comets \\nand finding out if any are hazards to Earth, have played a major role in designing these exercises \\nsince the first 11 years ago.  \\n“These hypothetical scenarios are complex and take significant effort to design, so our purpose \\nis to make them useful and challenging for exercise participants and decision -makers to hone \\ntheir processes and procedures to quickly come to a plan of action while addressing gaps in the \\nplanetary defense community’s knowledge,” said JPL’s Paul Chodas, the director of CNEOS.  \\nThe Impact Scenario  \\nThis year’s scenario: A hypothetical asteroid, possibly several hundred yards across, has been \\ndiscovered, with an estimated 72% chance of impacting Earth in 14 years. Potential impact \\nlocations include heavily populated areas in North America, Southern Eu rope, and North Africa, \\nbut there is still a 28% chance the asteroid will miss Earth. After several months of being \\ntracked, the asteroid moves too close to the Sun, making further observations impossible for \\nanother seven months. Decision -makers must figu re out what to do.  \\n \\nExplore asteroids and near -Earth objects in real -time 3D  \\n \\n Leading the exercise was NASA’s Planetary Defense Coordination Office ( PDCO), the Federal \\nEmergency Management Agency Response Directorate, and the Department of State Office of \\nSpace Affairs. Over the course of two days in April, participants gathered at the Johns Hopkins \\nApplied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, which hos ted the event, to consider the \\npotential national and global responses to the scenario.  \\n“This was a very successful tabletop exercise, with nearly 100 participants from U.S. \\ngovernment agencies and, for the first time, international planetary defense experts,” said Terik \\nDaly from APL, who coordinated the exercise. “An asteroid impact would h ave severe national \\nand international ramifications, so should this scenario play out for real, we’d need \\ninternational collaboration.”  \\nReality Informs Fiction  \\nIn real life, CNEOS calculates the orbit of every known near -Earth object to provide assessments \\nof future potential impact hazards in support of NASA’s planetary defense program. To make \\nthis scenario realistic, the CNEOS team simulated all the observatio ns in the months leading up \\nto the exercise and used orbital determination calculations to simulate the probability of \\nimpact.  \\n“At this point in time, the impact was likely but not yet certain, and there were significant \\nuncertainties in the object’s size and the impact location,” said Davide Farnocchia, a navigation \\nengineer at JPL and CNEOS, who led the design of the asteroid’s orbit. “It was interesting to see \\nhow this affected the decision -makers’ choices and how the international community might \\nrespond to a real -world threat 14 years out.”  \\nOptions to Deflect  \\nPreparation, planning, and decision -making have been key focal points of all five exercises that \\nhave taken place over the past 11 years. For instance, could a reconnaissance spacecraft be \\nsent to the asteroid to gather additional data on its orbit and bet ter determine its size and \\nmass? Would it also be feasible to attempt deflecting the asteroid so that it would miss Earth? \\nThe viability of this method was  recently demonstrated  by NASA’s Double Asteroid Redirection \\nTest (DART), which impacted the asteroid moonlet Dimorphos on Sept. 26, 2022, slightly \\nchanging its trajectory. Other methods of deflection have also been considered during the \\nexercises.  But any deflection or reconnaissance mission would need many years of preparation, requiring \\nthe use of advanced observatories capable of finding hazardous asteroids as early as possible. \\nNASA’s Near-Earth Object Surveyor, or  NEO Surveyor , is one such observatory. Managed by JPL \\nand planned for launch in late 2027, the infrared space telescope will detect light and dark \\nasteroids, including those that orbit near the Sun. In doing so, NEO Surveyor will support PDCO’s \\nobjectives to discover any hazardous asteroids as early as possible so that there would be more \\ntime to launch a deflection mission to potential threats.   \\n ', metadata={'source': 'temp.txt'})]"
